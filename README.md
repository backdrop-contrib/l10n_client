# Localization client

This module helps you fix translations on your site as you see the issues.
Just by navigating around your pages, you'll be able to fix translations
and fill in missing ones using the on-page translation editor.

Until https://github.com/backdrop-ops/localize.backdropcms.org/issues/7 is
addressed, only local translation is possible.
